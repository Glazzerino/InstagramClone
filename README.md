Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1.Parse cloud functions
2.Efficiency of Glide caching with Parse's getURL() result

## Notes

Not knowing the specifics of how Parse handles the database request kind of caused me to realize deleting a user but not their posts causes the app to crash.

Finding the camera implementation was rewarding but a bit hairy at first since there's a LOT of outdated guides. This only applies if you did not use the SDKs explained in the codepath guide, which is a nice guide. This project followed the official android guide to using CameraX.
